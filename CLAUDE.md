## Architecture

Two-layer SOA with 21 independently deployable services in a Turborepo monorepo:

**Platform Layer (12 services)** — domain-agnostic, reusable across future products:
Messaging (Twilio), Email (SendGrid), Notification (SSE + Redis pub/sub), Template, Nurturing Engine (drip sequences), Automation Engine (event-driven workflows), Audience Engine (segment evaluation), AI (Claude API gateway), Analytics, Integration Hub (Google Ads + Meta), Identity (auth/RBAC), Media (S3/CloudFront)

**Product Layer — Ortho CRM (8 services)** — consume platform via REST + events:
Lead Service (core entity), Pipeline Engine (state machine), Conversation Service (SMS inbox), Campaign Service (email broadcasts), Referral Service, Reporting Service, Data Import Service (Ortho2 CSV), CRM API Gateway

**Frontend (1 app):** React 18 + TypeScript SPA at `apps/crm/web`. Embeds platform UI components (`@platform/template-ui`, `@platform/sequence-ui`, `@platform/audience-ui`, `@platform/automation-ui`) as React packages.

```

Each service follows: `src/{routes,services,repositories,events}/` + `migrations/` + `test/` + `Dockerfile`

### Communication Patterns

**Async — AWS EventBridge** for state-change propagation (no direct coupling between publisher and consumer).

**Sync — REST** for queries and immediate commands (e.g. `POST /templates/render`, `POST /messages/send`, `POST /ai/complete`).

### Notification Service — Key API Decisions

Transport: SSE (not WebSocket) — strictly server-to-client. Product services call `POST /notifications/publish` directly (no EventBridge). Redis pub/sub (`PSUBSCRIBE notif:*`) handles cross-instance fan-out. Channels are arbitrary strings; channel access control enforced via JWT claims (`location:{id}:*` checks location claims, `user:{id}:*` checks JWT subject). Persistence: 7-day TTL, one row per publish, per-user read state in `notification_reads`. `Last-Event-ID` replay uses monotonic `seq bigint` (Postgres sequence), not UUID. `read-all` publishes single bulk Redis message → `event: read-all` SSE type. `POST /notifications/:id/read` returns `404` for expired/missing notifications.

### Template Service — Key API Decisions

`POST /templates/render` accepts `template_id` (uuid) + `context` object → returns rendered `body_text` (SMS) or `subject` + `body_html` + `body_text` (email). Always renders `active_version` — returns `404` if `active_version IS NULL` or `status = disabled`. Merge tag syntax: `{{key}}` with dot-notation support. Missing tags → empty string + log. In-memory cache 30s TTL; `POST /templates/:id/disable` eagerly evicts cache. Email templates store pre-rendered HTML (Unlayer export) + Unlayer JSON (for re-editing); SMS templates store plain text. Two-table versioning: `templates` group + `template_versions`. **Call chain:** Automation Engine and Nurturing Engine workers call `POST /templates/render` first, then pass pre-rendered body to Messaging/Email Service — Messaging Service never calls Template Service. **Pending:** Automation Engine spec (Section 6) and Nurturing Engine spec need amendments to reflect this call chain.

### Audience Engine — Key API Decisions

Callers submit entity data (hybrid push model) — engine never calls product APIs. Named segments (versioned, draft/active/disabled) + inline one-offs. `POST /audiences/segments/:id/evaluate` (batch, caller-generated `snapshot_id`) → entity-ID-only snapshot, 48h TTL. `POST /audiences/evaluate` (inline, `snapshot: false` returns IDs directly; `snapshot: true` stores snapshot). `POST /audiences/segments/:id/check` (single entity, synchronous, no snapshot). Snapshot cleanup: per-snapshot BullMQ delayed job + hourly safety-net sweep. Membership check cache: full resolved segment keyed by `segment_id`, 30s TTL. Shared `@platform/filter-engine` package (pure functions, zero deps) used by both Automation Engine and Audience Engine — Automation Engine migration replaces `condition-evaluator.ts` with thin wrapper passing event object as entity. Extended temporal operators: `within_last`, `not_within_last`, `before`, `after`, `date_range` (Audience Engine only). `@platform/audience-ui`: `<SegmentBuilder fields onSelect onFetchEntities? />` + `<AudiencePreview segmentId />`.

### AI Service — Key API Decisions

Thin Claude API gateway — no stateful agent behavior (AI Agent autonomous mode lives in Conversation Service). Single endpoint: `POST /ai/complete` with `{ prompt_id, context, model? }` → `{ text, model, prompt_id, cached }`. Sync only (no streaming). Static prompts as TypeScript files in `src/prompts/` — changes require deploy. Model routing: `"haiku"` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `"sonnet"` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`; prompt sets default, caller can override; invalid model string → 400. Response cache: L1 in-memory LRU 500 entries / 60s TTL + L2 Postgres `ai_completions` 5min TTL, keyed on SHA256(prompt_id + model + canonicalized context). `ai_completions` is a response cache only — not an audit log. LLM observability via Arize Phoenix (OpenInference SDK instrumentation; `ARIZE_PHOENIX_ENDPOINT` env var). No Redis, no BullMQ, no events published. Error shape: `{ "error": "<message>" }` — 503 for all Claude API errors (5xx, 429, 529). **Pending:** Arch doc Section 2.1 lists "streaming" and "usage metering" for AI Service — both are out of scope; arch doc needs amendment.

### Analytics Service — Key API Decisions

EventBridge → SQS → typed event handlers → atomic write: raw `analytics_events` log + daily rollup table update (single DB transaction). Nine typed handlers dispatched via plain `switch` in `event-router.ts` (no registration map). Storage: `analytics_events` (24-month partitioned, with default partition for late-job safety) + 6 named rollup tables (`metrics_leads_daily`, `metrics_pipeline_daily`, `metrics_conversions_daily`, `metrics_messages_daily`, `metrics_ad_spend_daily`, `metrics_campaigns_daily`). Idempotency: `ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING` on raw insert skips rollup for counter-increment handlers — **exception:** `AdSpendSyncedHandler` always executes rollup upsert to allow corrected re-syncs. Ad spend arrives via `ad_spend.synced` event from Integration Hub (payload: `platform`, `location_id`, `synced_date` + `records[]`). API: named endpoint families `GET /analytics/metrics/{leads|pipeline|conversions|messages|ad-spend|campaigns}` with shared `period`/`granularity`/`location_id` params + `POST /analytics/query` generic DSL against raw event log (single event type, equality/IN filters, 10k row cap). No platform UI component — Reporting Service owns dashboard. **Pending amendments required:** Messaging Service spec (add `location_id` to `message.delivered`, `message.failed`, `opt_out.received` payloads); Pipeline Engine spec (`lead.stage_changed` must carry `location_id`, `pipeline`, `stage_to`; `lead.converted` must carry `location_id`, `channel`); Campaign Service spec (`campaign.sent` must carry `campaign_id`, `location_id`); Email Service spec (add `email.opened`, `email.clicked` events with `campaign_id`, `location_id`); arch doc event table (add all above events).

### Messaging Service — Key API Decisions

`POST /messages/send` accepts `template` (string) + `context`, or pre-rendered `body`. Callers embed the template string inline — the Messaging Service does not store templates by ID. Duplicate `dedup_key` returns `200` with the original `message_id` (not `409`). Events published: `inbound_message.received` (includes `message_type`: `normal`|`stop`|`unstop`), `message.delivered`, `message.failed`, `opt_out.received`, `opt_out.removed`.

### Golden Rules (from arch doc)

1. Each service owns its DB schema — no cross-service table reads, all access through APIs or events.
2. Platform services never import product types — Automation Engine receives generic `{ entity_type, entity_id, event_type, payload }`.
3. Pipeline Engine only manages state — emits events; Automation Engine acts.
4. Platform UIs (`@platform/*`) call their own service's API directly from the browser (not proxied through CRM API Gateway). Auth uses the same Identity Service JWT.

## Core Product Concepts

**Three Patient Pipelines:**
1. New Patient (7 stages): New Lead → Contacted → Exam Scheduled → Exam Completed → Tx Presented → Contract Signed → Lost
2. In Treatment (3 stages): New Patient → In Treatment → Treatment Complete
3. In Retention (3 stages): Active Retention → Recall Due → Long-term Follow

**Roles:** Call Center Agent, Call Center Manager, Marketing Staff, Marketing Manager

**Lead channels:** Website forms, Google Ads, Facebook/Instagram Lead Ads, Twilio call tracking, referral links, walk-in/manual, chat widgets, Google Business Profile, CSV bulk import

**Key constraints:**
- No PHI at launch — leads are prospective patients, non-HIPAA initially
- Multi-location native (34 locations)
- Primary KPI: Cost per case start
- EHR integration is future (Ortho2 CSV bridge is temporary)
